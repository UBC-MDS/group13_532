## Reflection

### Has it been easy to use your app?

By end of Milestone four, we tried our best to implement what we sketched and apply the changes based on the feedback and peer review. below are some changes we have made to our app:

1. The app title become bigger and more centered
2. For a better understanding of sub-sections, each sub-section has the title
3. theme changed to Netflix theme and colors to give more sense of Netflix Analytics to users.
4. Based on the feedback and peer review, we change the location of plots to make it easy for a user to interact.
5. Scatter plot changed to line plot to show the cast number trend during the time.
6. tooltip info for all plots is added
7. Based on peer revies, the barplot color changes from one color to two different colors to show the top country which produces movies.

Our app usage and interaction now become easier, more flexible, and more understandable.

### What differences are there between the DashR and DashPy app?

### Are there reoccurring themes in your feedback on what is good and what can be improved?

### Is there any feedback (or other insight) that you have found particularly valuable during your dashboard development?

We tried to implement all feedbacks we got from peers to improve our app. adding a box to give a summary of the analysis is valuable feedback to make a user get what he/she wants in just a glance. We have not implemented it yet, but we might add it in the future.
