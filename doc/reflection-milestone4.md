## Reflection

### Has it been easy to use your app?

By end of Milestone 4, we tried our best to implement what was originally sketched, as well as apply the changes based on the feedback and peer review. below are some changes we have made to our app:

1. The app title is bigger and more centered
2. For a better understanding of sub-sections, each sub-section has the title and informative test
3. Theme of dashboard changed to Netflix theme/colors to match Netflix aesethetic.
4. Based on the feedback and peer review, we swapped the positions of plots to make it easy for users to interact with.
5. Scatter plot changed to line plot to show the cast number trend during the time.
6. Tooltip info for all plots added
7. Based on peer revies, the barplot color changes from one color to two different colors to show the top country which produces movies.

Our app usage and interactions are now easier, flexible, and more intuitive to use. 

### What differences are there between the DashR and DashPy app?

Luckily, we did not run into a lot of issues translating the Python code into an R dashboard. The main difference between the DashR and DashPy app are probably the physical appearance of the dashboards, since they were worked on by different people so they don't match perfectly! But overall, the elements are the dark/black backgrounds/card with red as a secondary color. Additionally, it was not as easy to implement a regression line in the scatter plot in Altair, so the R dashboard is a scatter plot with a regression line, while the Python dashboard is a line graph. 


### Are there reoccurring themes in your feedback on what is good and what can be improved?

A reoccuring theme in our feedback was improving the user experience. Our milestone 3 dashboard was rather plain and straightforward to use -- there was no cohesive theme that tied all the plots together, as well as very little text to provide users with context about how to use the dashboard. 


### Is there any feedback (or other insight) that you have found particularly valuable during your dashboard development?

We tried to implement all the feedback we got from peers to improve our app. I think the most valuable feedback was the suggestion to add some text to each plot to explain what each plot was trying to accomplish/provide some context.
