# Movie Dashboard

## About

Have you wondered how film studios decide which movies would appeal to their audiences? Our movie dashboard will give insight to these questions based on ten years of Netflix data (2008 - 2019). The app will allow users to explore the trends of film genres on Netflix, film length, film rating, and filming location by country. The motivation for our dashboard is to visualize the types of films will most likely appeal to streaming platforms and their audiences. For further details about the intentions for this dashboard, check out [our full app proposal](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/movie_dashboard/blob/main/Proposal.md)

## Description of App
The app contains a landing page with three visualizations. A global filter of the year is located on the right-hand side of the menu controls these plots. Each plot will have an interactive filter to visualize trends over time. A dropdown menu will allow multi-selection of movie rating and a date range selector to narrow down genre results, based on movie release date.

### 1. Country versus Movie count (Bar chart)

Users can see a bar chart that depicts the number of movies belonging to a particular country in the selected period. Number of movies can also be filtered on the movie duration, to see which countries tend to produce longer movies. This visualization can help users gather insight into which countries are most popular for filming locations. 

### 2. Genre popularity (Pie chart)

This pie chart shows the share of each genre in the movie market. The pie chart can be be filtered by date range to zero in on trend during a certain time period. This visualization would help users answer the question, "Which genres tend to be well received by audiences?", allowing users to make informed decisions on the genres that Netflix tends to release on it's platform. 

### 3. Release month versus Movie rating (Line chart)

Movie rating is an important factor when considering audience -- rating a film R vs. PG-13 massively shifts the audience a movie is geared towards. In this plot, users will see a line plot depicting how the number of movies produced for a particular rating has changed over time. This visualization will answer the question, "Do people have more tendency for specific movie rating in recent years?". This could help the production team make a more informed choice on what content should be or should not be in their movies, as well as predict when the demand is high for certain film ratings.
