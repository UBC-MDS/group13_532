# Movie Dashboard

## Description of the app

Have you ever thought about how studios can make a decision on what movie they should produce that would appeal to their audience? we want to make an app to give this insight to these studies based on ten years of Netflix data. Our app will allow users to explore the trends of film genres on Netflix, film length, film rating, and filming location by country.

The app contains a landing page with three visualizations. A global filter of the year located on the right-hand side of the menu controls these plots. Each plot has its filter as well. A dropdown menu allowing multi-selection of movie rating and a date range selector to narrow down genre results, based on movie release date.

### 1. Country versus Movie count (Bar chart)

The user can see a bar chart that depicts the number of movies belonging to a particular country in the selected period. They can also filter it based on the movie duration to see which countries tend to produce longer movies. It can help the studios to get insight into which countries spend more budget on the movie entertainment market.

### 2. Genre popularity (Pie chart)

This pie chart would show the share of each genre in the movie market. It would help the user answer the question - Which genres tend to be well received by audiences and would allow the studios to make a more informed decision on the kind of movie to produce.

### 3. Release month versus Movie rating (Line chart)

The studios would see a line plot depicting how the number of movies produced for a particular rating has changed over time. It would help provide insights to answer the question "Do people have more tendency for specific movie rating in recent years?". This could help the production team make a more informed choice on what content should be or should not be in their movies, and when the demand is high for these movies to release their films.
